                Sprite Studio is my 2D graphic creation tool. It uses a unique, old school-inspired rendering trick which allows for runtime modification of graphics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Sprite Studio is intended for game developers to create great looking, dynamic 2D graphics. Couple with that it's built-in animation system and Steam Workshop-powered extensions, and you have a game artist's best friend.

            <p>
                STEEL Core is my software library. STEEL Core's purpose for being is to make desktop application development with Java and LWJGL easier (or at least have less boilerplate), while still giving full control to the developer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The developer can create multithreaded rendering systems and rapidly prototype shaders and UIs with relative ease. And when full control is needed, the developer can go straight down to OpenGL, OpenAL, Nuklear, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                STEEL Core doesn't cover all of LWJGL. But it does help with the most basic stuff so creating a window takes a few lines of code rather than over 100.

            <p>
                COLDSTEEL Engine was my first large project. It is a 2D game engine developed by me and really how I learned how to build software. It's somewhat large and contains a lot of features, but for the most part it's not useful to anyone because I didn't know how to code propperly when I was working on it. Now, its pretty much abandoned, but I still like to mention it because it has a ton of features.
