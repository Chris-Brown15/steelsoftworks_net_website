        <p>
            I am currently in school to get my masters degree in Computer Science, so that takes up a great deal of my time. When I do have time, I am trying to get Sprite Studio into my ideal state. I want that to be a completed, stand-alone product that is ready to use and relatively bug free.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this, I want to make games. I have several ideas for games which I'll share at a future date. For now, keep on the lookout, I'll be sharing more soon.
