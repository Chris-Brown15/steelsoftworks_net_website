        <p>
            COLDSTEEL Engine was my first major software project. I started it shortly after learning the basics of programming. It's written in Java with LWJGL. By my current standards, its terribly written, but I am proud of it nonetheless because I was able to implement many features by myself.

            This image is an example of CE's editor. Each box, when expanded, has a utility for making edits to whatever the user has selected:

            CE was intended to be the engine I'd use for my dream game. This dream game is supposed to be a 2D sidescrolling action game, so I was trying to create an engine for that. CE has its own physics, collisions, hitboxes, animations, scripting, entity component system, and even networking - all written by me.             
        </p>

            This image is an example of working in the editor to create a hitbox for an entity:

            I came up with designs for the engine basically on the fly with little to no prior planning. There certainly wasn't a design document of any kind. It's fun to program in that way, but it doesn't lend itself to great end products. I was recreating Castlevania: Symphony of the Night in the engine, primarily as a testing platform. This is why you'll see SOTN sprites being used in the engine.

            COLDSTEEL Engine was basically sunk by networking. Netcode can be extremely complicated when a more sophisticated design is used. I was copying Blizzard's netcode design for Ovewatch, which is detailed in <span class = "link-text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks98kE3cs30&t=90s">this video</a></span>. That was such a difficult undertaking that it's not too surprising that it basically caused a snowball effect that couldn't be overcome, and I had to move on from the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day, though, I'll make a new game engine using STEEL Core that will be everything COLDSTEEL Engine tried to be. For now though, enjoy a few more screenshots of the engine at work:
